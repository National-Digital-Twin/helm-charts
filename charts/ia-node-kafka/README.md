# ia-node-kafka

**Repository:** `[helm-charts]`  
**Helm-Chart-Name:** `[ia-node-kafka]`  
**Description:** `[National Digital Twin Programme Helm chart for Kafka, a helper package to support deployment of the IA Node]`  
**SPDX-License-Identifier:** `Apache-2.0 AND OGL-UK-3.0 `  

## Overview  

The Helm chart `ia-node-kafka` is intended to ease deployment and configuration of Apache Kafka which is a prerequisite required to deploy an IA Node (Integration Architecture Node).

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics and data integration, the helper package `ia-node-kafka` intends to ease first time deployments for testing. 

[Overview of Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)

This chart has been developed to provide an example deployment of a Kafka Cluster using the [Kafka Strimzi Operator](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/strimzi-kafka-operator/strimzi-kafka-operator) for use specifically with the IA Node secure graph component. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Secret management is outside of the scope of the deployment, however we have provided a few possible examples on how you might override the default values or provide your own where supported.

## TL;DR

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The installation assumes that Istio has already been installed Istio, following the [Istio Helm Install](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/helm/) guide, and assumes a default principal of `cluster.local/ns/istio-system/sa/ingressgateway`, and default gateway of `istio-system/istio-gateway`.

```sh
helm install my-release oci://ghcr.io/national-digital-twin/helm/ia-node-kafka -n ia-node
```

Optionally, use an overrides.yaml:

```sh
helm install my-release oci://ghcr.io/national-digital-twin/helm/ia-node-kafka -n ia-node -f ./overrides.yaml 
```

## Prerequisites

You will require the following technologies installed and configured to get started. 

Versions highlighted are based on what configurations have been used throughout the testing of the Helm chart. 

- **Supported Kubernetes Versions:** 
  - [`Kubernetes 1.23+`](https://kubernetes.io/): a Kubernetes cluster i.e. AKS or local development cluster 
  
- **Required Tooling:**
  - [`kubectl 1.28.9+`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/): prior knowledge, usage and experience with `kubectl` 
  - [`Helm 3.8.0+`](https://helm.sh/): prior knowledge, usage and experience in Helm
  - [`jq 1.6+`](https://jqlang.org/): for querying and formating json
  
- **Optional Tooling:**
  - [`K9s 0.32.5+`](https://K9scli.io/): for Kubernetes cluster overview and visualisation of deployments
  
- **Installation Requirements:** 
  - [`Istio Helm chart, Gateway, Base and Istiod 1.25.0+`](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/helm/): service mesh that layers onto existing application, providing uniform and more efficient ways to secure, connect, and monitor services
  - [`Kafka Strimzi Operator 0.45.0+`](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/strimzi-kafka-operator/strimzi-kafka-operator): bootstraps the Strimzi Cluster Operator Deployment, Cluster Roles, Cluster Role Bindings, Service Accounts, and Custom Resource Definitions for running Apache Kafka

## Installing the Chart

Install the Kafka Strimizi Operator and then run the following to install. Ensure that 'watchAnyNamespace' is set to true if you want the operator to work against any namespace. 

```sh
helm install my-strimzi-cluster-operator oci://quay.io/strimzi-helm/strimzi-kafka-operator  --namespace kafka-operator --create-namespace --set watchAnyNamespace="true"
```

Create the target namespace if it does not already exist, typically this will be the same namespace as the core IA Node application. 

```sh
kubectl create namespace ia-node
```

If running Istio in side car mode, remember to add the injection label: 

```sh
kubectl label namespace ia-node istio-injection=enabled
```

Install the latest chart: 

```sh
helm install ia-node-kafka oci://ghcr.io/national-digital-twin/helm/ia-node-kafka -n ia-node
```

Optionally, use an overrides.yaml:

```sh
helm install ia-node-kafka oci://ghcr.io/national-digital-twin/helm/ia-node-kafka -n ia-node -f ./overrides.yaml 
```

## Uninstall the Chart

To uninstall the Helm chart:

```sh
helm uninstall ia-node-kafka -n ia-node
```

To uninstall the Kafka cluster operator: 

```sh
helm install my-strimzi-cluster-operator -n kafka-operator 
```

## Configuration and Installation details

### Istio

Any Istio examples throughout this documentation are provided largely as information to help support integrators to plan their own deployment.

The installation assumes that Istio has already been installed Istio following the [Istio Helm install](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/helm/) and assumes a default principal of `cluster.local/ns/istio-system/sa/ingressgateway` and default gateway of `istio-system/istio-gateway`. 

> [!NOTE]
> Istio `authorization policies` are implemented to restrict communications between components. These principals are based on the namespace a service is deployed to and the service account it runs as. In particular, the principal that the Istio ingress is assigned is environment specific and may differ from the one specified in the default deployment. These can all be overridden using the Helm values. 

### Secret Management

This chart provides a few options for managing the default secrets. 

#### Override the Value 

Override the secret value you pass to the chart on a Helm install/upgrade.

```sh
helm upgrade ia-node-kafka oci://ghcr.io/national-digital-twin/helm/ia-node-kafka -n ia-node \
  --set kafkaCluster.secret.password=ADD_YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE 
```

Verify the secret has updated by running: 

```sh
kubectl get secret kafka-ia-node-user -n ia-node -o json | jq -r '.data | with_entries(.value |= @base64d)'
```

> [!NOTE]
> The helm chart installation does take some time, so you may need to give it a few mins before verifying the secret.

#### Bring Your Own Secret

It is possible to opt for a "bring your own secret" by updating the secret name and disabling the default secret creation, but you do need to make sure that you replace "user" with the name of your intended user. 

Firstly, create two Kubernetes Secrets, the first is for setting up the Kafka user, the second uses the same information to configure the properties for the application. The names of both will be used in a later stage: 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: kafka-cluster
    strimzi.io/kind: KafkaUser
type: Opaque
stringData:
  password: somesuperawesomepassword
  sasl.jaas.config: org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required username="user" password="somesuperawesomepassword";
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: kafka-auth-config
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: kafka-cluster
    strimzi.io/kind: KafkaUser
type: Opaque
stringData:
  kafka-config.properties: |
    security.protocol=SASL_SSL
    sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-512
    sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required \
        username="user" \
        password="somesuperawesomepassword";
```

Apply into the same namespace where the Helm chart is being deployed: 

```sh 
kubectl apply -f ./kafkaclustersecret.yaml -n ia-node
```

Lastly, override the values on the install/upgrade replacing the secret name and username to match those you created: 

```sh 
helm upgrade ia-node-kafkaCluster oci://ghcr.io/national-digital-twin/helm/ia-node-kafkaCluster -n ia-node \
--set kafkaCluster.secret.create=false \
--set kafkaCluster.secret.name=kafka-auth-config \
--set kafkaCluster.secret.username=user
```

## Development and Testing

You can run the charts from the repository code directly if you plan to develop and test new updates to the charts. 

1. Clone the repository
2. If required add an `overrides.yaml` into the root directory of the chart (overrides.yaml is purposefully ignored on commit by `.gitignore`)
3. Set a terminal to run from the root directory of the repository
4. Then run either commands below depending on if you are working with overrides

```sh
helm install ia-node-kafka ./charts/ia-node-kafka -n ia-node -f ./charts/ia-node-kafka/values.yaml
```

```sh
helm install ia-node-kafka ./charts/ia-node-kafka -n ia-node -f ./charts/ia-node-kafka/values.yaml -f ./charts/ia-node-kafka/overrides.yaml 
```
